Stakeholder: Hey! I heard you’ve been working on a chatbot project. Can you tell me about it?

Gen AI Engineer: Absolutely! I’ve built a basic chatbot application using the Ollama Llama2 LLM. It’s designed to take user prompts, process them, and generate relevant outputs based on the query.

Stakeholder: Sounds interesting! What’s the user interface like?

Gen AI Engineer: I’ve used Streamlit to create a clean and interactive UI. It’s simple and intuitive—users can easily input their queries and view the responses.

Stakeholder: Cool! What about performance tracking?

Gen AI Engineer: Great question! I’ve integrated LangSmith for monitoring and tracking. This helps analyze the chatbot’s performance and ensures everything runs smoothly.

Stakeholder: Is it live somewhere?

Gen AI Engineer: Not yet live, but the code is available on GitHub if you’d like to explore it. Plus, I’ve attached a video demo so you can see the chatbot in action!

Stakeholder: That’s awesome! So, what’s next for this project?

Gen AI Engineer: For now, it’s a simple implementation, but I’m thinking about adding advanced features like conversational memory, multi-turn dialogues, and maybe even deploying it to a scalable platform. I’d love feedback or collaboration ideas!

Stakeholder: Thanks for sharing this! I’ll definitely check out the GitHub repo.
